# NSLS Builder Toolkit — one-command installer
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thensls/nsls-builder-toolkit/main/install.sh | bash
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --test      # isolated "new user" test install
#
# What this does:
#   1. Installs the NSLS org skills (local plugin)
#   2. Installs superpowers + compound-engineering plugins (marketplace)
#   3. Tells you to run /nsls-setmeup to connect your tools

# launched. `-t` / `--test` points that at a throwaway config dir
# ($HOME/.claude-kit-test by default, override with $CLAUDE_KIT_TEST_DIR) so you
# can install exactly like a brand-new user WITHOUT touching your real
# ~/.claude. To reset back to "new user", delete that dir. Launch a test
# install with:  CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-kit-test" claude

# own hooks are proven on this machine. It used to additionally write
# `nsls-builder-toolkit@local` into enabledPlugins, which did nothing — there is
# no marketplace called `local`, so Claude Code cannot resolve the key. This
# comment used to say that key "loads skills/commands/hooks", and that sentence
# cost two weeks of unguarded Macs:
# an 2026-08-23 test against it appeared to prove that a plugin's bundled hooks
# do not load, which is why the guardrail gate was taken out of hooks.json on
# 2026-09-06. The marketplace-installed plugin loads its bundled hooks exactly
# as documented. What the inert key genuinely does not do is register bundled
# .mcp.json servers, so the signal_* tools never appear on this path.
#
# Fix: register each server from .mcp.json explicitly at user scope, pointing at
# the absolute install path. That path is the same local-plugins dir the
# auto-update hook git-pulls, so server updates still flow through on the next
# session. `claude mcp add` is idempotent — it no-ops if the server already
