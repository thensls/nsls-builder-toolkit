"""Beacons, the versioned done-marker, and the inert @local key.

Plain stdlib, no pytest: run with `python3 hooks/tests/test_migration_beacons.py`.

Three failures this exists to prevent:

1. **A shim certifying its own retirement.** Stage B strips all three installer
   hooks off one shared marker. Windows has never been allowed to run it
   because nobody could prove the plugin's hooks fire there — and
   session-start.ps1 calls the plugin's session-start.py directly, so "this
   code ran" is not the same claim as "the plugin hook fired". A beacon written
   from anywhere but the plugin cache would authorise retiring a working hook.

2. **A permanent marker outliving its assumptions.** Stage B writes a marker
   and never runs again. That was safe until a later installer run added
   something new to settings.json — #168 added the guardrail gate on
   2026-09-07, and any machine that re-ran install.sh after that date keeps it
   forever. Versioning the marker buys exactly one more pass per schema bump.

3. **Deleting a plugin someone actually installed.** The `@local` enablement
   key is inert and misleading, but only where no `local` marketplace exists.
