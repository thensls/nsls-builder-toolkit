"""The Windows scripts refresh their own skill pointers, and only their own.

Plain stdlib: `python3 hooks/tests/test_ps1_pointer_marker.py`.

session-start.ps1 and install.ps1 overwrite ~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
only when that file is their own pointer, so they never clobber a skill the
builder wrote. Three ways that check has been wrong:

1. session-start.ps1 looked for 'local-plugins\\nsls-' (a backslash) while the
   pointers it writes use forward slashes, so it never matched and no pointer
   was ever refreshed.
2. The obvious fix, 'local-plugins/nsls-', matches any builder skill that merely
   mentions a toolkit path. Personal-toolkit stubs do, to log credit.
3. Even this skill's exact path is not enough on its own: a builder's own skill
   that credits or links the toolkit skill contains it too (Macroscope, #202).
   install.ps1's looser 'local-plugins[\\/]nsls-builder-toolkit' had the same
   problem.

So ownership is structural: the file must BE a pointer, front matter then one
"Read and follow" line naming this skill's own path. There is no PowerShell
where these tests usually run, so the predicate is rebuilt here from the
script's own pattern literal and exercised against real-shaped files; the
static checks pin both scripts to it. The Windows CI job parses the scripts.
