"""When the toolkit is allowed to say a checkout is FROZEN.

Plain stdlib, no pytest: these run on a stock install, same bar as the hook
they cover. Run with `python3 hooks/tests/test_freeze_warning.py`.

The false alarm these exist to prevent (2026-08-27): every session opened with
"nsls-builder-toolkit could not self-update: the checkout ... has local commits
or edits, so automatic updates are FROZEN" for BOTH toolkits, on checkouts that
were verifiably clean — 0 dirty files, 0 commits ahead of upstream, and a
`git pull --ff-only` returning 0 on the very next attempt. Builders were told to
back up local changes that did not exist, and the message that must never be
ignored became the one that always is.

Cause: `_warn_if_frozen` substring-matched git's output against `_FREEZE_SIGNS`
and then asserted "local commits or edits" without ever checking, discarding
git's text on the way — so the real reason was unrecoverable too.
