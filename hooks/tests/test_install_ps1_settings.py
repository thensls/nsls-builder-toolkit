"""install.ps1 gives settings.json back as it found it.

Plain stdlib: `python3 hooks/tests/test_install_ps1_settings.py`. No PowerShell
here: hooks/tests/windows/install-settings-roundtrip.ps1 runs the real
functions under Windows PowerShell 5.1 in CI. This pins the wiring.

Fable's review (2026-10-04): 5.1 read the BOM-less file as ANSI and wrote any
non-ASCII back garbled, with no copy and an in-place write; and the hook filter
dropped a whole matcher group, a builder's own hook included, if one of our
entries was in it.
