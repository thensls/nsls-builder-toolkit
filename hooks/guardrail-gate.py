"""
guardrail-gate.py — PreToolUse hook implementing the four NSLS hard gates.

Skills can't block. They're description-matched, so a builder who never types a
trigger phrase never meets one. This hook is deterministic: it sees every Bash,
Write and Edit call regardless of what the builder said.

The four gates (see CLAUDE.md § Builder Guardrails):
  1. NSLS work in a personal repo        — git remote isn't an NSLS org
  2. Tier 3 ship with no tracker record  — deploying member-facing, unowned
  3. Production write at scale           — bulk writes, no reviewer, no rollback
  4. Off-platform at Tier 2+             — non-Anthropic SDK on a shared build

DESIGN RULES, in priority order:

*   **Fail open, always.** Every failure path allows the action. A guardrail
    that bricks someone's session costs more trust than the risk it averts.
    Unparseable input, no network, no git, missing config — allow.
*   **False positives are the failure mode.** A gate that fires when it
    shouldn't teaches builders to route around the toolkit, and then it
    protects nobody. Every pattern here is deliberately narrow. When in doubt,
    stay silent.
*   **Never a flat no.** Each block states the policy AND the way through,
    including the authorization route. See _shared/references/guardrail-voice.md.
*   **Escape hatch.** NSLS_GUARDRAILS_DISABLED=1 turns everything off. A gate
    with no off-switch is a gate that gets uninstalled.
