"""
guardrail-gate.py — PreToolUse hook implementing the four NSLS hard gates.

Skills can't block. They're description-matched, so a builder who never types a
trigger phrase never meets one. This hook is deterministic: it sees every Bash,
Write and Edit call regardless of what the builder said.

The four gates (see CLAUDE.md § Builder Guardrails):
  1. NSLS work in a personal repo        — git remote isn't an NSLS org
  2. Tier 3 ship with no tracker record  — deploying member-facing, unowned
  3. Production write at scale           — bulk writes, no reviewer, no rollback
  4. Off-platform at Tier 2+             — non-Anthropic SDK on a shared build

DESIGN RULES, in priority order:

*   **Fail open, always.** Every failure path allows the action. A guardrail
    that bricks someone's session costs more trust than the risk it averts.
    Unparseable input, no network, no git, missing config — allow.
*   **False positives are the failure mode.** A gate that fires when it
    shouldn't teaches builders to route around the toolkit, and then it
    protects nobody. Every pattern here is deliberately narrow. When in doubt,
    stay silent.
*   **Never a flat no.** Each block states the policy AND the way through,
    including the authorization route. See _shared/references/guardrail-voice.md.
*   **Escape hatch.** NSLS_GUARDRAILS_DISABLED=1 turns everything off. A gate
    with no off-switch is a gate that gets uninstalled.

# ── Command segmentation ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Four Macroscope findings on PR #157 shared one root cause: the gates matched
# RAW COMMAND TEXT. So `echo 'git push origin main'` read as a push, a harmless
# `git push --help` in one segment vouched for a real push after the semicolon,
# `--dry-run` anywhere disabled the bulk-write gate for the whole line, and
# `cd elsewhere && railway up` was judged against the shell's cwd instead of
# the directory actually being deployed. The fix is one idea applied
# everywhere: split the command into the segments that actually execute, and
# judge each segment by its own tokens — where a quoted string is ONE token,
# so text inside quotes can never look like a command.

    The matcher admits six tool names; the gates read three shapes — a Bash
    command, a Write, an Edit.

    PowerShell is a first-class tool, not a synonym: Claude Code enables it
    automatically on Windows and its payload carries the command in the same
    `command` field Bash uses. Three of the four gates open with
    `if tool != "Bash": return`, so adding PowerShell to the matcher without
    this line would admit the call and then wave it through every command
    gate — the matcher would look fixed while nothing judged it.

    MultiEdit carries its text in edits[].new_string and NotebookEdit in
    new_source, so without this both are a silent bypass of gate 4 — the tool
    call is inspected, finds no `content` or `new_string`, and is waved through.
