The one place a guardrail event is turned into a tracker row.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS

    Until now `guardrail_blocked` was the only guardrail event anything ever
    sent, because the only emitter lived inside guardrail-gate.py's block()
    path. The other seven labels existed in Signal's `GUARDRAIL_EVENT_LABELS`,
    in register-automation/SKILL.md and in a docstring -- and nothing produced
    them. Three of the four tiles on Signal's guardrail page could therefore
    never move, and hard blocks are rare by design, so the honest reading of
    that dashboard was "permanently near-zero" rather than "nothing is
    happening".

    The soft events are the ones that carry the story. A hard block is the
    system failing to persuade someone; a registration, a reviewer being
    brought in, a build moving off a personal repo, a nudge being declined --
    those are the ordinary outcomes, and they are most of what the guardrails
    actually do. Leaving them unwired meant the page could only ever show the
    rare bad news.

    Both emitters (the PreToolUse gate, and guardrail-event.py for the
    conversational ones) come through here so the payload contract with
    POST /guardrail-event exists once. It was already duplicated once in a
    docstring that had drifted out of date.

THE PAYLOAD CONTRACT

    {"builder_email": str, "event_type": str, "description": str,
     "automation_name": str, "repo_url": str}

    lands in Airtable's Events table as Event Type / Description / Builder /
    Automation. `Event Type` is free text, so no Airtable schema change is
    needed; the proxy enforces a `guardrail_` prefix.

    `repo_url` exists because `automation_name` is a directory name
    ("mex-tools") while Airtable's Name is human-entered ("MEx Tools"), so name
    matching alone leaves most events with no build attached -- and an event
    trail that cannot say which build tripped the gate is most of the value
    gone. The Automations table already has a GitHub Repo URL field, which is
    an exact key rather than a guess.

WHY THE LABEL SET IS CLOSED

    The proxy only checks the `guardrail_` prefix. Signal checks the exact
    string: `isGuardrailLabel` drops anything not in its list, so an invented
    label like `guardrail_noticed` writes a real Airtable row that the
    dashboard silently ignores -- the worst outcome available, because it looks
    like reporting worked. LABELS below must stay in step with
    GUARDRAIL_EVENT_LABELS in Signal's lib/guardrails.ts.

# Measured against the live proxy on 2026-08-23, five sequential POSTs to
# /guardrail-event: 1.31s, 1.47s, 1.48s, 1.51s, 1.93s. The old value here was
# 1.5s -- sitting exactly on the median.
#
# What that actually did is worth being precise about, because the obvious
# reading is wrong. It did NOT lose the events: eight labels fired with the 1.5s
# ceiling reported six client-side timeouts, and all eight rows were in Airtable
# afterwards. The server finishes the write and answers 200; the client has
# already hung up. (Railway logs the same shape for /session-ping -- 499 "client
# has closed the request", server 200, row recorded.)
#
# The damage is subtler than loss and mostly downstream:
#   * the caller cannot tell a delivered event from a dropped one, so nothing
#     built on the return value can be trusted;
#   * a retry on that false failure writes a SECOND row -- the duplicate pairs
#     in Airtable from 2026-08-23 12:40 and 13:34 are exactly this;
#   * the gate spent 1.5s of its 10s budget waiting for an answer it discards.
#
# The lookup-plus-create is inherently ~1.5s, so the fix is not a bigger number
# picked by feel. Anything on a hook budget hands the POST to a detached child
# (emit_detached) and stops waiting; anything with time to spare waits long
# enough that a slow day doesn't turn a delivered event into a reported failure.
