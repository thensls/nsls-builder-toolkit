session-start.py — Cross-platform SessionStart hook for the NSLS Builder Toolkit.

Runs on every Claude Code session start. Does three things:
1. git pull the toolkit to get latest updates
2. Sync skill pointers from the plugin to ~/.claude/skills/
3. Ping the automation tracker for points, PR credits, and announcements

Must be fast and fail silently. Works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

    Parity fix with the Windows hook: session-start.ps1 has always looped
    @($BuilderDir, $PersonalDir) and pulled both, but this function pulled only
    the builder dir — so on macOS/Linux the personal toolkit was cloned once and
    then frozen at install-time state forever. Fixes shipped upstream (like the
    visual-companion self-heal) never reached those machines. SYNC_PLUGINS
    already names both toolkits for pointer sync; pull the same list.

    Bare `pull --ff-only` — no explicit remote/refspec — follows each
    checkout's configured upstream, the same convention personal-setup's own
    update path uses. Hardcoding `origin main` here would silently fast-forward
    a supported fork checkout (NSLS_PERSONAL_REPO / NSLS_PERSONAL_BRANCH) or a
    deliberately pinned detached HEAD onto a branch it never tracked; with no
    upstream configured, a bare pull just exits nonzero and the checkout is
    left alone. --ff-only matches the .ps1: the `pull origin main` this
    replaces could stop on merge conflicts (leaving a conflicted tree) or, on
    modern git with no reconcile config, refuse divergence outright — neither
    visible here, since the exit status is ignored and output captured, while
    the toolkit quietly never updated again. ff-only refuses cleanly instead
    of half-merging.

    Prompts are disabled (GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0, stdin closed) so a remote
    that wants credentials fails in milliseconds instead of hanging out the
    timeout, and the loop shares one 15s deadline so the worst case — every
    pull wedged — still leaves the 35s replay + 35s live ping inside the 90s
    hook budget install.sh configures.

    A pull refused for checkout-local reasons (divergence, dirty tree) prints
    a warning to stdout — SessionStart stdout reaches the model's context — so
    a frozen toolkit is announced instead of silently stale. Offline failures

       sessions" — which is exactly what fired the false alarm on 2026-08-20
       (three 499s inside six seconds, server recorded all three, no points
       lost, and it still told the builder to raise it in #builders).
    2. Only speak when the builder is actually losing something. A slow write
       is invisible to them: the payload replays at the next session start and
       daily points dedupe per builder per day, so the day's credit lands from
       whichever ping gets through.
    3. Never go quiet while it IS broken. The old `failures == 3` fired once
       and then never again for the life of an outage, which is the
       silent-forever mode the original comment was trying to avoid. Both
       notices below repeat once every 24h for as long as the condition holds.

    Every value read back from the marker is treated as hostile. The file is
    hand-editable, can be left half-written by a crash, and this function runs
