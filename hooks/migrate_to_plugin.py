"""
migrate_to_plugin.py — self-migration from the shim install to a real plugin.

Executed by session-start.py on every session start (from the freshly pulled
clone, so fixes to this file take effect one session after they land on main).
Two stages, at most one per session:

Stage A — plugin not installed yet:
    Register this repo as a private marketplace and install the plugin.
    Nothing else changes: the running session keeps using the shims, and the
    plugin loads at the NEXT session start. Anyone with git access to the repo
    can install; the marketplace is not public.

Stage B — plugin installed, shims still present (mac/linux only):
    Remove exactly the shims the installer created, now that the plugin
    provides the same components:
      * pointer stubs in ~/.claude/skills whose SKILL.md points at
        local-plugins/nsls-builder-toolkit/skills/ — personal-toolkit stubs
        and user-authored skills are never touched (their SKILL.md lacks that
        marker; see the /skills/ discriminator below),
      * settings.json hook entries whose command references
        nsls-builder-toolkit/hooks/ (session-start + skill-event),
      * the user-scope `signal` MCP registration if it points into this repo
        (the plugin registers signal at plugin scope).

Safety properties:
  * fail-open — every step is wrapped; any failure leaves the machine on the
    still-working shim path and retries next session
  * idempotent — each stage checks live state, never history
  * serialized — a lockfile keeps the settings-shim copy and the plugin-hook
    copy of session-start.py from migrating concurrently during the one
    overlap session
  * announced — every state change prints a visible line (silent failure is
    the recurring bug in this pipeline)
  * reversible — settings.json is backed up to settings.json.pre-plugin-migration
    before its first edit
  * escape hatch — set NSLS_NO_PLUGIN_MIGRATION=1 to freeze migration
  * Windows — NEITHER stage runs today, and this docstring used to claim
    stage A did. Nothing calls this module on Windows: session-start.ps1 is the
    hook that fires there, and its only entry into Python is
    runpy.run_path(..., run_name="__guardrails__"), which executes that block
    alone and never main(). That, not a shortage of installs, is why no PC has
    ever had the plugin — so no PC has the three agents, and stage B has never
    had anything to be deferred from. Wiring stage A into the Windows path is
    the Windows-parity change; stage B stays gated on per-hook beacon evidence
    that the plugin's own hooks actually fire on that machine.
