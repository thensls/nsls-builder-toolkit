"""Is a skill like this one already installed?

The registry check (`POST /similar`) answers "has anyone REGISTERED something
like this". For a skill that is the wrong corpus twice over: most skills never
get their own registry row, and the thing a new skill most often duplicates is
another skill sitting on the same machine.

That gap cost real time on 2026-09-19 -- a macroscope-watch skill was checked
against the registry, came back clean, and only turned out to sit beside an
existing `macroscope` skill when a human said "check the toolkit too". The two
were complementary in the end, but nothing in the check knew that.

So this reads the skills actually installed and scores them the same way the
registry check scores rows: same stopwords, same one-character plural folding,
same overlap coefficient, same 0.5 threshold. Consistent numbers matter more
than clever ones -- a builder seeing 0.61 from one check and 0.34 from the other
for the same pair learns to trust neither.

    similar-skills.py "<name>" "<one sentence>"

Prints matches, highest first, or nothing at all. Silence is the same contract
the registry check keeps: no match is not evidence of no neighbour.
