# them) but none of the conversational half - tiers, escalation triggers, the
# voice guide, remembered declines - which is the same
# configuration-present-but-not-loaded failure this project has hit three times.
# Delegated to the Python emitter rather than reimplemented: one copy of the
# section-extraction and path-resolution logic, not two that can drift.
# The same Python entry point also runs ensure_plugin_fresh(): the daily
# `claude plugin update` plus the commit-level drift check and self-heal. The
# plugin's own hooks.json hook invokes `python3`, which on stock Windows is a
# Store alias that exits without running, so THIS script is the only place the
# freshness step reliably fires on Windows. It is a no-op unless the plugin is
# installed and enabled; clone-only machines stay fresh via the git pull above.
# Interpreter: the stock Windows `python3` is a Store alias that exits without
# running anything, so falling back to it emitted nothing at all - worse than
# failing loudly. Prefer the launcher, then the toolkit-provisioned runtime,
# and give up quietly only when there is genuinely no Python.
