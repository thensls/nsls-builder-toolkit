#        upstream, so a customized fork (NSLS_PERSONAL_REPO/BRANCH) or a pinned
#        checkout is never fast-forwarded onto a branch it doesn't track.
#        A pull refused by the checkout's own state (divergence, dirty tree) is
#        announced on stdout - SessionStart stdout reaches the model's context -

# is the only hook that runs on a PC: Windows has had no guardrail gate
# registered in settings.json, so the plugin (stage A) is what brings the gates.
#
# The step used to run `py -3 -c $program`, and Windows PowerShell 5.1 strips
# the double quotes inside an argument it hands to a native program. Python got
# `run_name=__guardrails__`, raised a NameError, and exited 1 - on every PC,
# every session, since the step was added. `2>$null` threw the traceback away
# and try/catch never sees a native exit code, so nothing ever said so. Hence a
# file entry point, whose path has no quotes to lose, and hence the exit code
# is now checked and a failure reported (see Report-ShimStuck).
#
# Interpreter: the stock Windows `python3` is a Store alias that exits without
# running anything, so falling back to it emitted nothing at all. Prefer the
# launcher, then the toolkit-provisioned runtime, then `python`.
