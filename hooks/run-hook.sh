# run-hook.sh — the single cross-platform entry point for the toolkit's Python
# hooks.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. hooks.json has no OS conditional, so a plugin hook that runs
# Python has to name one interpreter for every machine. The two alternatives
# both fail somewhere:
#   * a bare `python3` entry errors on stock Windows, where `python3` is a
#     Microsoft Store alias that exits without running anything (that error is
#     why the gate was pulled out of hooks.json on 2026-09-06, which is what
#     left every migrated Mac with no gate at all);
#   * registering the hook twice (`python3` and `py -3`) means the absent twin
#     prints a "<hook> hook error" notice on EVERY matching tool call, on every
#     machine — unsuppressable, because swallowing it needs a shell.
# One shell-form entry per hook, with "shell": "bash" named explicitly in
# hooks.json, resolves the interpreter here instead. install.ps1 hard-requires
# Git for Windows, so Git Bash is present wherever this has to run.
#
# CONTRACT: exit 2 passes through (the only code that blocks a tool call);
# everything else exits 0 with whatever the script printed. A hook that cannot
# run is silence, never a notice — fail open is the gate's first design rule.

# Resolving the interpreter costs a probe subprocess, and this runs before every

# format tag and an ABSOLUTE path: validating it is then a file test, a changed
# format invalidates every old entry at once, and a Python that was upgraded or
# removed fails the test and costs exactly one re-probe.
# Every fallback is itself defaulted. With `set -u`, expanding $HOME when HOME
# is unset aborts the script outright — before the interpreter is even probed —
# so the gate does not fail open, it fails silent, which is the one outcome
# this file exists to prevent. Same hole the Python side had at import time.

# A zero exit status is NOT proof of a Python. install.ps1 documents exactly what
# this guards against: the stock Windows `python` / `python3` App Execution
# Aliases can exit 0 having run nothing at all. A probe that accepted exit 0
# would cache one of those, and from then on every hook would "succeed" having
# executed nothing -- silently, no notice, no beacon, no gate. That is this
# entire outage reproduced one layer down. So the probe demands a sentinel on
# stdout, which only a real Python 3 can produce.
# A candidate that hangs would otherwise hold the whole probe loop until the
# hook's own 10s timeout, so the interpreters after it are never reached. Cap
# each probe WHERE THE TOOL EXISTS: `timeout` ships with Git for Windows and on
# Linux, and is absent from a stock macOS. Hard-coding it would make every probe
# on a Mac fail "command not found" — no interpreter found, gate silently off,
# which is the outage this file exists to end. Unquoted on purpose below: empty
# must expand to no argument at all.
