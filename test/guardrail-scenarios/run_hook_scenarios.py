run_hook_scenarios.py — run the hook half of the guardrail scenario matrix.

    python3 test/guardrail-scenarios/run_hook_scenarios.py [-v]

Feeds each `kind=hook` scenario to guardrail-gate.py as a synthetic PreToolUse
payload and asserts allow/block. Exits non-zero if any scenario fails.

TOUCHES NOTHING REAL. No network, no live APIs, no deploys, no installs, no
GitHub repos. Scenarios needing a git remote get a throwaway repo created in the
system temp dir and deleted immediately after — never inside a real project.

The suite is deliberately weighted towards allow-cases. A gate that fires when
it shouldn't teaches builders to route around the toolkit, and then it protects
nobody — so false positives are treated as the more serious failure.
