install.ps1 - NSLS Builder Toolkit installer for Windows (full native).

Windows counterpart to install.sh. Bash isn't on a stock Windows box, so this
does the whole install in PowerShell (the Windows hooks are native PowerShell).
It also provisions the runtime prerequisites the toolkit's skills need - Python
3.12 + python-docx + python-pptx (and the nsls-python launcher the document
skills call), the gws CLI, and Node.js for the signal MCP server - and
checks for (but never installs) the MS Visual C++ x64 runtime that gws depends
on:

  0. Provision prerequisites (Python + doc libraries + nsls-python, gws, Node); VC++ check
  1. Clone / update the org plugin
  2. Enable it + register the PowerShell hooks in settings.json
  3. Fire an install event to the Automation Tracker (platform: windows)
  4. Install the superpowers + compound-engineering marketplace plugins
  5. Register bundled MCP servers (stdio directly; http via --transport http,
     deferring token-gated servers to /signal-setup)
  6. Sync slash-command pointer skills
  7. Print next steps (desktop-first)

Self-bootstrapping - safe to run piped straight from the web:
  powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thensls/nsls-builder-toolkit/main/install.ps1 | iex"
It clones the repo itself (Step 1) before needing any file from it, so it never
depends on $PSScriptRoot. Also runs from a local checkout.

Idempotent: re-running updates the clone and no-ops anything already in place.
