"""Refuse a PR to main that does not bump `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Usage: python3 .github/scripts/check_plugin_version.py [--changed-files PATH]
                                                      <base-ref> [<head-ref>]

With one positional argument the PR head is the working tree. With two, the
head manifest is read from <head-ref> via `git show` — the shape the workflow
uses under `pull_request_target`, where this script and the workflow come
from the BASE branch and nothing from the PR is ever executed, only read.

`--changed-files PATH` names a file holding the PR's changed paths, one per
line, as returned by the GitHub API (see CONTEXT_ONLY_PREFIX below).

Why this gate exists: builders run the toolkit from a VERSION-PINNED plugin
cache. `claude plugin update` compares version strings and nothing else, so a
merge that leaves the version alone is a merge no machine ever receives — the
CLI keeps saying "already at the latest version" over a stale cache. Eight PRs
landed that way between 2026-09-05 and 2026-09-09 (37 commits, the whole
guardrails series) and nobody got them.

Rule: the version on the PR head must be strictly greater than the version on
the base branch, compared numerically as X.Y.Z. Patch for fixes, minor for new
skills or behavior, major for breaking changes to how builders install or use
the toolkit. A base with no manifest at all (the first version ever) passes.

# Data the toolkit READS, written by the weekly Sync Org Context job from
# Airtable — org-chart.json, the LOPs, the strategy docs. None of it is code,
# none of it changes plugin behavior, and it has no version to bump.
#
# Requiring a bump here is what broke the sync: on 2026-08-31 branch protection
# started demanding a PR plus these two checks, the bot's direct push to main
# began failing with GH006, and org-chart.json froze at the 2026-08-24 copy for
# four weeks while every dashboard read healthy. The sync now opens a PR
# (.github/workflows/sync-org-context.yml) and this exemption lets that PR pass.
#
# Distribution still works: ensure_plugin_fresh() in hooks/session-start.py
# compares the installed COMMIT against the marketplace HEAD, not just the
# version string, and reinstalls on drift — so an unbumped context merge still
# reaches builders within a day. That commit check is the backstop this
# exemption leans on; if it is ever removed, this exemption has to go with it.
