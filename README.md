# NSLS Builder Toolkit

Organization skills for every NSLS builder — building, tracking, deploying, presenting, and researching. Install once, get updates automatically.

Also installs **Superpowers** (planning, debugging, verification) and **Compound Engineering** (brainstorm, plan, review, git) plugins.
The NSLS Builder Toolkit gives every NSLS employee with Claude Code a set of skills for building, tracking, querying data, and deploying automations. Install once, get updates automatically.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thensls/nsls-builder-toolkit/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open Claude Code and say `/setup` to connect your tools and optionally install personal productivity skills.

## Org Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **/setup** | Onboarding — connect tools, install personal skills |
| **/register-automation** | Track your work in the NSLS Automation Tracker |
| **/product-design** | UX guardrail — DESIGN.md, reviews, focus groups |
| **/nsls-focus-group** | Test ideas with simulated employee panels |
| **/nsls-slides** | Branded NSLS/Society presentations |
| **/frontend-slides** | Build HTML presentations |
| **/gdoc-build** | Build nicely-formatted NSLS/Society Google Docs — real Word tables, branded headers, headings, code blocks. Survives copy-paste into canonical docs. |
| **/google-drive** | Google Drive file management |
| **/google-slides-api** | Edit existing Google Slides via API |
| **/gws** | Google Workspace Sheets CLI |
| **/netlify-deploy** | Deploy and preview static pages |
| **/deployment-guide** | How to deploy to Railway, Airtable, GAS, Cloudflare |
| **/nsls-auth** | Wire "Sign in with NSLS" SSO into any NSLS-controlled app via auth.nsls.org (web, mobile, Netlify static sites) |
| **/pydoc-pipeline** | Generate documentation from Python code |
| **/web-research** | Structured web research |
| **/interrogate** | Deep-dive investigation skill |

## Strategy & Knowledge Work

For non-software work — campaigns, strategy docs, briefs, research synthesis. The four `kw:` skills form a pipeline: brain dump → structured plan → reviewed → learnings captured.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **/kw:brainstorm** | Brain dump and compile NSLS knowledge before structuring a plan. Use after a meeting or when you have scattered inputs that need organizing. |
| **/kw:plan** | Research what NSLS already knows, then structure a plan grounded in LOPs and past learning. Use after `/kw:brainstorm`. |
| **/kw:review** | Two-reviewer parallel check on a plan — one audits LOP grounding and goals, the other audits every number for source and freshness. P1/P2/P3 findings before you share. |
| **/kw:compound** | Extract 1–3 learnings from a finished session and route them to the right tier (personal Obsidian, team `_shared/learnings/`, SLT knowledge graph). |

Use these for strategy/knowledge work. For software features use `/ce:brainstorm` → `/ce:plan` → `/ce:work` → `/ce:review` from the Compound Engineering plugin. For new automations start with `/interrogate`.

## Bundled Plugins

These are installed automatically by the install script:

| Plugin | What it gives you |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Superpowers** | `/brainstorm`, `/debug`, `/verify`, `/plan`, `/tdd` |
| **Compound Engineering** | `/ce:brainstorm`, `/ce:plan`, `/ce:work`, `/ce:review`, `/git-commit` |

## Personal Productivity Skills (Optional)

During `/setup`, you can optionally install personal productivity skills — daily planning, weekly reviews, project logging, relationship tracking. These are Kevin's personal template — fork them, edit them, make them yours. They live in a [separate repo](https://github.com/thensls/nsls-personal-toolkit).
## First-Time Setup

After installing, run `/connect` in Claude Code to connect your data systems (PostHog, Airtable, Slack, Customer.io, n8n, and more). Each connection persists across sessions — you only do it once per system.

├── /notion                  — (seed) Team wiki, docs, databases.

├── /figma                   — (seed) Design files, components,

└── /hex                     — (seed) Data notebooks, SQL queries,
                               shared analytics. Collaborative
                               data exploration.

Layer 1: INFRASTRUCTURE
└── /connect                 — The bridge between credentials and data.
                               Detect what's connected, walk through
                               setup for what's missing, handle the
                               failures that will happen along the way.

Layer 0: THE SCHEMA
└── /system-of-record        — The unified data model made conversational.
                               9 domains, 95 tables, Person.id as
                               universal anchor. Knows both the target
                               schema AND the current fragmented reality.
                               The foundation everything maps onto.
```

**Layer 0** is the schema — the unified data model that defines what member data looks like when all systems agree. **Layer 1** gets the pipes connected. **Layer 2** knows how to use each pipe well — one skill per system, with safety tiers, diagnostic loops, and org-specific gotchas. The seeds are systems with auth available but not yet explored — each one is a `/data-model-discovery` run waiting to happen. **Layer 3** is cross-system intelligence — combining data from multiple Layer 2 skills to answer questions no single system can. **Layer 4** is the meta layer — skills that create new skills, discover unnamed patterns, map new data sources, and find ground truth.

They form a cycle: `/data-model-discovery` explores a new system → maps it against `/system-of-record` → produces a platform skill (via `/skill-creation` rubric) → feeds into `/data-intel` → which `/investigation` can query for ground truth → and `/full-shape` can use to define patterns nobody's named yet. Every seed that gets connected and explored adds another row to Layer 2 and another dimension to Layer 3.

## Updates

Skills auto-update when you start a Claude Code session. To update manually:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/local-plugins/nsls-builder-toolkit && git pull
```

## Skill Usage Tracking

Every time you invoke a skill (`/open-day`, `/log`, `/learn`, etc.) the toolkit
posts a deduped event to the Automation Tracker. We use this to measure skill
breadth and learning velocity across builders — not to grade you. One event
per builder per skill per day; no payload content is sent.

The ping fires from two places — the `PreToolUse` hook (CLI + desktop) and a
one-line `Bash` call embedded in each skill's pointer (works wherever skills
run). The server dedupes per builder/skill/day, so both producers can fire
without inflating counts.

### Opt out

Set `BUILDER_EMAIL=""` in `~/.claude/local-plugins/nsls-personal-toolkit/.env`.
Both producers check this value before pinging; an empty email disables them
both, permanently, with no other side effects.

Editing `hooks/hooks.json` to remove the `PreToolUse` block doesn't work as a
durable opt-out — the file is overwritten on the next `git pull` of the
toolkit. Empty `BUILDER_EMAIL` is the canonical path.

### Known limitations

- **Tracking only fires for builders whose `BUILDER_EMAIL` is set.** Running
  `/personal-setup` writes it; running only the org-side `/setup` does not.
  Builders who skip personal-setup are invisible until they configure it or
  until a separate fix wires `BUILDER_EMAIL` into the builder-toolkit
  installer.
- **The `PreToolUse` hook only ships in this plugin.** Builders who install
  only the personal toolkit (no builder-toolkit) get no hook coverage — they
  rely solely on the pointer self-report, which won't fire for skills outside
  the personal toolkit's catalog.
- **Counts can occasionally exceed one row per builder/skill/day.** The
  dedupe is a read-then-write scan with no unique constraint, so two producers
  firing within ~100ms of each other can both pass the check before either
  writes. Use `COUNTUNIQUE(Builder)` for "% of builders" queries.
