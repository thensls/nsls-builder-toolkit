# Register Automation

Register or update NSLS automations in the Automation Tracker and automatically
link the builder as owner/maintainer. The proxy handles points, stage
advancement, and assignment creation.

**Proxy URL**: `https://web-production-6281e.up.railway.app`

## How It Works

This skill is a thin layer over a smart proxy. The proxy handles:
- Finding/creating the automation record
- Linking the builder as Owner/Maintainer
- Calculating points for stage changes and checklist completions
- Checking and applying builder stage advancement (Explorer → Maker → Builder → Architect → Steward)
- Logging all events for audit

The skill's job: detect context, gather data, call the proxy, present results.

## Light path: log an exploration

For a build that is real but early — no ship, no team, just someone making
something — use the exploration log instead of full registration. The offer,
the once-per-build rule, and the decline handling live in CLAUDE.md § The
exploration log. Mechanics: `POST /similar` first (offer to claim an
idea-backlog row or an intro on a live match), then
`POST /register-automation-with-builder` with `stage: "Exploring"`,
`scope: "Personal"`, and their one-sentence description. Ask none of the
checklist/reviewer/design-doc questions. Later escalation updates the same row
via the full flow below.

## Step 1: Detect the Builder

Auto-detect who's registering. Try these in order:
1. `git config user.email` — most reliable
2. Read email from `~/.claude/local-plugins/nsls-personal-toolkit/.env` or `~/.claude/local-plugins/nsls-builder-toolkit/.env`
3. Ask: "What's your NSLS email?"

Verify the builder exists: `POST /find-builder` with `{"email": "<detected>"}`.
If not found, offer to register them: `POST /builder` with their details.

## Step 2: Detect the Automation

### In a git repo (auto-detect mode)

Scan the repo:
- `git remote -v` → GitHub URL, repo name
- **`code_on_github` means the NSLS org owns the code — not that git is in use.** Set
  `code_on_github: true` only when the `origin` remote is `github.com/thensls/<repo>`
  (SSH or HTTPS). A personal-account remote is `false`. Getting this wrong is how a
  Production automation ends up registered as org-owned while its code sits in someone's
  personal account — which is the exact governance gap the checklist exists to surface.

  When the remote is personal, say so plainly and hand over the fix:
  > Your remote is `<owner>/<repo>`, not in the `thensls` org, so this registers as *not*
  > org-owned. To transfer: repo **Settings → Danger Zone → Transfer ownership → `thensls`**.
  > Org members have repo-create rights, so you don't need an admin. Two things to do in
  > the same sitting:
  > - **Scan the git *history* for credentials before you transfer.** The org is on GitHub
  >   Team, which has no secret scanning for private repos — nothing will catch a key
  >   that's already sitting in an old commit. If history is dirty, squash to a fresh
  >   initial commit and push that instead of transferring.
  > - **Add your reviewers explicitly.** The org's default repository permission is `none`,
  >   so transferring alone gives teammates zero access — they'll get a 404 until you add
  >   them as collaborators.
- `README.md` exists? → `readme: true`
- `CLAUDE.md` exists (root or `.claude/`)? → `claude_md: true`
- `docs/runbook.md` or `runbook.md`? → `runbook: true`
- `docs/architecture.md` or `architecture.md`? → `architecture_doc: true`
- `DESIGN.md`? → `design_intent: true`
- `railway.toml` or `Procfile`? → `deployed_shared_infra: true`
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators --jq length` > 1? → `collaborators_on_repo: true`

Check if it's already tracked: `POST /find` with `{"name": "<repo name>"}`.

If found: note the current `stage` as `previous_stage`.
If not found: this is a new registration.

Ask the user only for fields you can't detect:
- **Required if new**: description
- **Recommended**: department, scope, type, stage
- **Optional**: everything else

### Guardrail fields (set these alongside scope)

`scope` doubles as the guardrail tier — `Personal` = Tier 1, `Department` =
Tier 2, `Company-wide` = Tier 3. Four fields hang off it:

| Field | When to set |
|---|---|
| `Platform Used` | Always. `Anthropic` (default) / `OpenAI` / `Other`. |
| `Design Doc URL` | Tier 2+. Link the doc `/product-design` produces. |
| `Reviewer` | Tier 3 always; Tier 2 when effort > ~2 days. Links to the Builders table. |
| `Review Status` | Tier 2+. `Not needed` → `Requested` → `In review` → `Go` / `Go with notes` / `Pull in another reviewer` / `Slow down`. |

**Reviewer pool:** Kevin (platform, architecture, member-facing — final say) ·
Davo (Tier 2/3 design, skills, agentic flows) · Jenna (adoption, UX, HR-ops
surfaces) · a domain reviewer when the build crosses into their flow.

**Platform check.** If `Platform Used` is not `Anthropic` and scope is
`Department` or `Company-wide`, that's a hard gate — it needs a short written
memo plus Kevin's sign-off. Say so, and offer to draft the memo in the same
breath. Never a flat no.

**Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/references/guardrail-voice.md` before raising any of this.**

### Not in a repo (manual mode)

Ask for:
- **Required**: name, description
- **Recommended**: department, scope, type, stage
- **Optional**: everything else

## Step 3: Register

Call `POST /register-automation-with-builder`:

```json
{
  "automation": {
    "name": "...",
    "stage": "...",
    "department": "...",
    "...all detected and user-provided fields"
  },
  "builder_email": "jdoe@nsls.org",
  "previous_stage": "Prototype"
}
```

### Record it as a guardrail event

Straight after a successful registration, before presenting results:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/guardrail-event.py" registered \
  "MEx Tools registered at Tier 2 — Claude raised it, builder registered the same session" \
  --automation "<repo or name>"
```

Every registration, not only the ones a guardrail prompted. A registered build
is a build somebody owns, which is the whole point; and Signal reads the absence
of this event as "declined and carried on", so a voluntary registration that
goes unreported makes a careful builder look like a careless one. Say in the
description whether a guardrail prompted it — that distinction is worth having,
but it belongs in the sentence, not in whether the row exists.

## Step 4: Present Results

From the response, show:

**Always:**
> Registered **[Name]** at [Stage]. You're listed as owner/maintainer.

**If checklist items were updated:**
> Updated org-owned checklist: README, CLAUDE.md, GitHub repo confirmed.

**If stage_advanced is not null:**
> This moves you from [from] to **[to]** — [encouragement based on stage]:
> - Maker: "You're getting your hands dirty."
> - Builder: "You've shipped something real."
> - Architect: "You're building systems that outlast you."
> - Steward: "You own it. Others depend on it."

**Always — close with what's still open.** This is the part that makes the checklist
work. Registration currently ends on a completed note, so builders walk away thinking
they're done and the remaining items go untouched for weeks. Leave the loop open.

Call `GET /builder-stats/{builder_email}`, find the automation you just registered, and
read `checklist_complete`, `checklist_total`, and `checklist_remaining`. Then show:

> Checklist: **7 of 12.** Still open:
> - **Collaborators on Repo** — teammates can't review until you add them
> - **Service Account Creds** — so it isn't running on your personal credentials
> - **Deployed on Shared Infra** — off your own account, onto shared
> - **🎰 Won the Lottery** — could someone else run this if you disappeared tomorrow?
> - **DESIGN.md** — why this exists, for whoever inherits it

Two rules for how you say it:

1. **Frame these as what makes the automation survivable, not as a debt owed.** The
   builder just shipped something; this is the difference between a tool and an asset.
2. **Name which open items their current work already covers.** Most builders are
   mid-migration or mid-deploy, and two or three of the open items are things they're
   doing this week anyway — pointing that out converts a list into momentum. If a stage
   or scope answer implied upcoming work (a cutover, a handoff, a new environment), say
   which boxes it will tick.

**Key → label.** Mirrors the tracker's checkbox fields. Title-case any key not listed
here rather than dropping it — the field set grows.

| Key | Label |
|---|---|
| `code_on_github` | Code on GitHub (in the `thensls` org) |
| `readme` | README |
| `claude_md` | CLAUDE.md |
| `runbook` | Runbook |
| `architecture_doc` | Architecture Doc |
| `service_account_creds` | Service Account Creds |
| `deployed_shared_infra` | Deployed on Shared Infra |
| `env_vars_documented` | Env Vars Documented |
| `collaborators_on_repo` | Collaborators on Repo |
| `handoff_guide` | Handoff Guide |
| `won_the_lottery` | 🎰 Won the Lottery |
| `design_intent` | DESIGN.md |

**Do NOT show points to the builder.** Points are Kevin's internal metric. The checklist
count is different — **do** show that. Completion is the builder's own signal; points
are not.

## Checking Status

If the user asks "what automations do we have" or "show me the tracker":
- `GET /automations` to list all
- Present as a table: name, stage, department, type

If the user asks "what are my automations":
- `GET /builder-stats/{email}` to get their portfolio
- Show automations with checklist progress

## Scope Change Check — the tier gate

Scope changes are how Tier 1 builds become Tier 2 and Tier 3 ones, so this is
where most guardrail conversations actually happen.

When scope rises (Personal → Department, Department → Company-wide, any →
Customer Facing), gate on design-doc depth **before** letting `stage` advance
past `Idea`:

| New scope | Depth needed | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| `Department` (Tier 2) | Light — 1-pager, 20–30 min | No. Strong suggestion; take the first no gracefully and log it. |
| `Company-wide` (Tier 3) | Standard or Extensive | **Yes.** Registration must exist before code, and a reviewer must be assigned. |

Run `/product-design` in Generate Mode to produce the doc, then write the URL to
`Design Doc URL` and set `Review Status` to `Requested`.

**Tier 3 hard gate.** A Company-wide or member-facing automation may not advance
to a shipping stage without a tracker record and an assigned `Reviewer`. State
the policy, then offer the authorization route — Kevin can authorize an
exception, and you should offer to draft that note immediately. Never a flat no.

**Emit the event either way** (see Guardrail Events below) — a declined
suggestion is as worth recording as an accepted one.

## Guardrail Events

Every guardrail moment gets an `Events` row so it can be reported on. `Event Type`
is free text, so no schema change is needed; Signal reads it via the existing
15-minute Airtable→Supabase sync.

**How to record one.** One command, from anywhere:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/guardrail-event.py" <label> "<what happened>" [--automation <name>]
```

`<label>` is the bare word — `mentor`, `disputed`, `registered`. It prints one
line saying what it did and always exits 0; a tracker that is down or slow is
never a reason to interrupt what the builder is doing. Two it handles on its own,
so don't send them by hand: `blocked` comes from the gate itself, and
`proceeded` from `guardrail-memory.py record` when a builder declines.

Only the labels below are accepted. The proxy checks the `guardrail_` prefix but
Signal checks the exact string, so an invented label would write a real Airtable
row that the dashboard silently ignores — reporting that looks like it worked.
The command refuses unknown labels instead.

| Event Type | When |
|---|---|
| `guardrail_flagged` | Claude raised a tier flag |
| `guardrail_registered` | Build registered — note in the description if a flag prompted it |
| `guardrail_mentor` | Reviewer or mentor brought in |
| `guardrail_migrated` | Repo moved to the NSLS org, or platform moved to Anthropic |
| `guardrail_proceeded` | Builder declined; build continued (soft path) |
| `guardrail_blocked` | A hard gate stopped the action |
| `guardrail_authorized` | Kevin authorized an exception to a hard gate |
| `guardrail_disputed` | Builder says a block misfired — **log it, don't argue** |

Set `Description` to one plain sentence naming the build and what happened, and
link `Builder` and `Automation` where known. These four counts — acted on,
declined, hard blocked, authorized — are what the guardrail report shows.

**Only record what actually happened.** A repo move is observable. Whether a
reviewer genuinely reviewed, or whether someone really migrated off OpenAI, is
not — those are self-reported. Never emit `guardrail_migrated` or
`guardrail_mentor` on the strength of an intention.

### Disputed blocks — the feedback loop

Some gates will misfire in situations nobody could simulate, and a builder who
hits a wrong block with no way to say so quietly stops trusting the toolkit.

When a builder says a block was wrong, record it immediately, before replying:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/guardrail-event.py" disputed \
  "bulk-write gate fired on a 30-row backfill into her own test base — she was rehearsing before the real run"
```

Put in the description what they were trying to do, which gate fired, and their
reason in their own words. Then help them get where they were going — the
authorization route is still open, and a disputed block is not an argument to
win. **Never push back before logging it.**

These surface in the guardrail report's Needs-attention list, which is the only
channel through which a false positive ever becomes visible. Treat a rising
dispute count as the system working, not failing.
