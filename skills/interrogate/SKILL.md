name: interrogate
description: >-
  Interrogate a project or automation idea until goals, scope, risks, audience,
  and trade-offs are crystal clear. Produces an Obsidian project file, DESIGN.md,
  and Automation Tracker registration. Use when the user says "interrogate this",
  "new project", "new automation", "I have an idea", "help me scope this",
  "define this project", "what should I build", or is starting something new
  and needs to think it through before building. Also use when a builder wants
  to register an automation they've built but hasn't documented it yet.

# Interrogate

Interrogate the user relentlessly about every aspect of their project or automation until you reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the decision tree — goals, scope, audience, stakeholders, dependencies, risks, metrics — resolving them one by one.

If a question can be answered by checking existing project docs or dashboards, have the user point you there and treat those as the source of truth instead.

**This skill does not write code.** It produces three outputs:
1. An **Obsidian project home note** (if the user uses Obsidian)
2. A **DESIGN.md** file (for automations with user-facing interactions)
3. An **Automation Tracker registration** (via the register-automation skill)

---

## Step 1: Establish Context

Ask these first — one at a time, not a wall of questions:

1. **"What are you building?"** — Get a plain-language description. No jargon.
2. **"Who is it for?"** — Specific people or roles, not "the team." How many? What's their tech comfort?
3. **"What problem does it solve?"** — What's painful today? What does the user currently do manually?

If the user already has a repo, scan it:
```bash
# Check for existing docs
ls README.md DESIGN.md CLAUDE.md docs/ 2>/dev/null
git remote -v 2>/dev/null
```

If they have existing docs, read them and skip questions they already answer.

---

## Step 2: Walk the Decision Tree

Go through each branch. Ask one question, wait for the answer, then follow up or move to the next branch. Don't rush.

### Goals
- What does success look like in 30 days? 90 days?
- What's the single most important outcome?
- How will you know it's working? (Not "metrics" — what would you observe?)

### Scope
- **Stage**: Is this an idea, prototype, production tool, or something already running?
- **Department**: Which NSLS department owns this? (People/HR, Client Services, Marketing, Finance, SLT, Product, Engineering)
- **Reach**: Personal (just you), Team (your department), Department+ (cross-team), Org-wide?
- What's explicitly NOT in scope? (This prevents scope creep later)

### Audience / Customers
For each user segment:
- Who are they? (role, name if known, count)
- When do they encounter this? (trigger, context, mindset)
- What do they actually do? (their actions, not the system's)
- What do they see back? (output, confirmation, result)

### Stakeholders & Collaborators
- Who else cares about this? (manager, sponsor, DRI)
- Who needs to approve before it ships?
- Who will maintain it after you move on?

### Dependencies
- What systems does this connect to? (Airtable, Slack, Google Workspace, Railway, etc.)
- What access do you need that you don't have?
- Is anything blocking you from starting today?

### Risks & Trade-offs
- What could go wrong? (data quality, user confusion, breaking existing workflows)
- What are you choosing NOT to do, and why?
- What's the rollback plan if it doesn't work?

### Metrics
- How will you measure adoption? (concrete: "X of Y people use it weekly")
- How will you measure satisfaction? (concrete: response rate, feedback, opt-out rate)
- What's a red flag that means you should stop or pivot?

---

## Step 3: Synthesize and Confirm

After the interrogation, present a summary back to the user:

```
Here's what I understand:

**Project**: [name]
**Problem**: [one sentence]
**Solution**: [one sentence]
**Audience**: [who, how many]
**Scope**: [stage, department, reach]
**Success looks like**: [observable outcome]
**Key risk**: [biggest thing that could go wrong]
**Dependencies**: [systems, access, people]

Does this look right? What did I miss?
```

Wait for confirmation. Iterate if needed.

---

## Step 4: Write the Outputs

After the user confirms, produce all three outputs.

### 4A: Obsidian Project Home Note

Check if the user has an Obsidian vault:
```bash
[ -d "$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents" ] && echo "obsidian" || echo "no-obsidian"
```

If yes, create the project home note. Use the template from the `/log` skill:

```
~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/KP/20-projects/[slug]/[slug].md
```

**Frontmatter fields** (map from interrogation answers):

```yaml
---
title: "[Project Name]"
aliases:
  - "[Short Name]"
type: project
collaborators:
  - "[[Collaborator Name]]"
repos:
  - "thensls/[repo-name]"
status: [idea | active | paused | done]
priority: [1-5, where 1 is highest]
energy: [low | medium | high]
domain: [nsls | personal-productivity | slt-ops | people-ops | personal]
department: "[Department Name]"
tags:
  - [relevant-tag]
blocked-by: [dependency or empty]
next-action: "[First concrete step]"
last-touched: [today's date YYYY-MM-DD]
---
```

**Body sections:**
- **What This Is** — from Step 1 answers
- **Current Phase** — from scope/stage
- **Key Decisions** — from trade-offs discussed
- **Open Questions** — anything unresolved from the interrogation

Also create the first session log at `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

### 4B: DESIGN.md

If the automation has user-facing interactions (Slack messages, emails, web UI, scheduled prompts), generate a DESIGN.md.

Read the full template at: `~/.claude/local-plugins/nsls-builder-toolkit/skills/product-design/references/design-md-template.md`

Map interrogation answers to template sections:
- **What This Is** ← Step 1 problem/solution
- **Customers** ← Step 2 audience segments
- **UX Principles** ← derive from audience context and risks (4-7 principles)
- **What This Should NOT Become** ← Step 2 scope exclusions and risks
- **Interaction Surface** ← Step 2 audience "what do they do / what do they see"
- **Measuring Success** ← Step 2 metrics

If the automation is purely backend (no user interaction), skip DESIGN.md and note why.

### 4C: Register in Automation Tracker

Use the `register-automation` skill to register or update the automation in Airtable. Map fields:

| Interrogation answer | Tracker field |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Project name | `name` |
| Plain-language description | `description` |
| Department | `department` |
| Stage (idea/prototype/production) | `stage` |
| Reach (personal/team/dept/org) | `scope` |
| GitHub repo URL | `github_repo_url` |
| Builder name | `builder_name` |
| DESIGN.md exists | `design_intent: true` |

If the user doesn't want to register yet (it's just an idea), skip this step and note it as a next action.

---

## Step 5: Present and Confirm

Show the user what was created:

```
Created:
- Obsidian project: 20-projects/[slug]/[slug].md
- DESIGN.md: [repo path]/DESIGN.md (if applicable)
- Automation Tracker: [registered / skipped — register when ready]

Next action: [first concrete step from the interrogation]
```

---

## Tone

Be thorough but not tedious. If the user gives a long answer that covers multiple branches, acknowledge what's covered and skip those questions. If they say "I don't know yet," that's a valid answer — note it as an open question and move on.

The goal is shared understanding, not a form to fill out.
