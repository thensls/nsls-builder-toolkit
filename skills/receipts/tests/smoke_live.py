"""Live smoke test — NOT part of the unit suite. Hits real endpoints.

Catches Anthropic changing the invoices endpoint shape and Ramp auth dying —
the two most likely ways this skill breaks in production, silently, between
runs.

Not every machine that runs this has every prerequisite: a live `ramp auth
login` session is required, but `ANTHROPIC_ORG_UUID` + a stored claude.ai
session are not always present (e.g. a fresh laptop, CI, a colleague who only
uses the Gmail source). A missing prerequisite is reported as SKIPPED and does not fail the
run — that's an environment gap, not a code regression. Only a genuinely
unexpected failure (auth alive but rejected, a shape that changed, a PDF that
isn't a PDF) exits non-zero. Every check prints exactly what it verified, or
says plainly that it verified nothing — this script must never report "OK"
for something it didn't actually check.
