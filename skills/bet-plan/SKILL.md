description: >-
  Use when a Strategy Studio bet has cleared research and needs its board-memo
  back half: hardened economics (2026–2028 model, downside/base/upside),
  execution & risk, and a sell-first proof plan with thresholds and an
  investment ask — ending in an adversarial review before the planned→live
  gate. Triggers: "plan the bet", "bet plan", "economics for this bet", "proof
  plan", "investment ask", "design the experiment", "downside base upside",
  "get this bet to live", "board memo pages 4 and 5", "adversarial review",
  "red-team this bet", "stress test the memo".

# bet-plan

## SAFETY: THREE-TIER PERMISSION MODEL

1. **Read-only** — `get_bet`, `list_assumptions`, `list_bets`,
   `get_stack_rank`. Free, no confirmation needed.
2. **Configuration / new-content** — `update_section` (`econ.*`/`exec.*`/
   `proof.*` on this bet), `add_experiment`, `upsert_assumption`,
   `score_rubric`. Say out loud what's being written as you go — which
   field, what tag or grade — no per-call confirmation.
3. **Write to shared systems** — `advance_stage`, `set_status`. **Confirm
   the exact values with the human before writing.** No-token/no-server
   branch prints the would-be calls instead of guessing or failing silently.

Every write in every tier passes `via: "bet-plan"`.

## Purpose

A bet arrives here with a canvas, a thesis, and a first-cut economics page
drafted honestly enough to clear the research→planned gate — but nobody has
yet built the model a board would trust, named the top five risks out loud,
or tried to sell the thing before building more of it. `bet-plan` is pages
4 and 5 of the memo: it hardens `bet-research`'s estimates into a
named-assumption model with three honestly-differentiated cases, forces the
execution and risk questions onto the page, designs a sell-first experiment
with thresholds the owner would actually act on, and — before any of that
goes to the board — puts the whole memo in front of a reviewer who has never
seen it before and owes the author nothing. It ends the way `bet-idea` and
`bet-research` do: an explicit ask, never an assumed yes.

## When to use

- A bet already at `planned` stage (handed over by `bet-research` or
  `bet-studio`) needs its economics hardened, execution/risk pages written,
  or a proof plan designed.
- Running or resuming the adversarial review before a planned→live advance.
- Checking planned→live gate progress, or deciding whether a bet has earned
  the advance to `live`.
- **NOT** for a bet still at `research` stage with `market.*`/`econ.*`
  incomplete or the conversation/demand checks unmet — that's
  `bet-research`. **NOT** for a bet already `live`+ — that's `bet-run`
  (Phase 5, not built; say so plainly). **NOT** for portfolio-wide review or
  experiment tracking — those are `bet-review`/`bet-run`.

## Quick Start

Planned-stage bet → **P1** Economics hardening → **P2** Execution & risk →
**P3** Proof plan → **P4** Adversarial review loop (max 2 rounds) → **P5**
The advance offer → a live-ready bet (or an honest "not board-ready yet,
here's what's failing").

## Operating rules

- **Show the gate progress bar** (per `references/gate-progress.md`) after
  every `exec.*`/`proof.*` write and at the end of every session.
- **Never call `advance_stage` as a probe** — planned→live carries no
  attestation either, so a passing gate MOVES the bet the instant you call
  it. Compute progress from `get_bet` instead (verbatim rule in
  `references/gate-progress.md`).
- **Named-assumption discipline on every number** (per
  `references/economics-model.md`) — a number without the assumption that
  produces it, stated inline, is an opinion wearing a suit.
- **Sell-first by default** (per `references/experiment-design.md`) — the
  channel picks the instrument; a build experiment always needs stated
  rationale, and a dogfood bet's internal-need rationale is first-class, not
  an apology.
- **The adversarial review is mandatory, not optional busywork** — it runs
  in a fresh subagent with zero shared context, max 2 fix rounds, and it
  cannot be silently skipped.
- **Consume `staleAssumptions`** from every `update_section` response —
  announce it and re-interrogate the listed assumptions, never skip
  silently.
- **Heartbeat every step.** Say what you're about to do, do it, then report
  what happened before moving on. Never batch silently through the workflow.

## Entry: resume vs. route elsewhere

**Trigger:** the user names an existing bet, or `bet-research`/`bet-studio`
hands one over with a `bet_id`. Call `get_bet` first.

- **Normal path** — stage `planned`, status `active`.
- **Stage `research`** — check the research→planned summary in
  `references/gate-progress.md`. If any of the seven checks read red, route
  back to `bet-research` with one sentence naming which check failed. If the
  checklist reads green but the bet was never advanced (an owner sat on a
  ready bet), say so, offer the advance for the owner to confirm (`via:
  "bet-plan"`), and only then continue into `bet-plan`'s own work.
- **Stage `idea`** — route to `bet-idea`.
- **Stage `live`+** — `bet-run` territory (Phase 5 — say plainly it's not
  built); `bet-studio` for anything else that doesn't fit.
- **On resume:** inventory which `exec.*`/`proof.*` fields are still empty,
  and whether an adversarial review round is already on record — check
  `exec.top_risks` content for an "Adversarial review round N" block (Step
  P4 writes one after every completed round, even when no fixes were
  accepted). The planned→live progress bar IS the resume agenda — don't
  re-derive a different one.

## Step P1 — Economics hardening

Per `references/economics-model.md`: revise `econ.model_2026_2028` and
`econ.cases` from `bet-research`'s first-cut estimates into the full
named-assumption model, with the three-case `data` shape (downside connected
to what would actually have to go wrong, upside connected to what would
actually have to go right — never a flat percentage of the base case).
Reconcile against the `market.obtainable` numbers `bet-research` already
sized both ways — **divergence is a finding**, not something to paper over.
Update `econ.revenue_drivers`, `econ.cost_structure`, and
`econ.unit_economics` wherever the hardened model sharpened them.

Every write is honestly tagged (`estimate` by default, `assumption` where a
driver is still untested, `data` only for costs actually paid today). Any
new load-bearing model assumption gets `upsert_assumption`'d, not left to
live only in prose.

## Step P2 — Execution & risk

Write, all with named specifics rather than roles-in-the-abstract:

- `exec.capabilities` — what we have today vs. what must be acquired.
- `exec.team` — named people and fractions of their time, not "a PM."
- `exec.dependencies` — internal and external, each with an owner.
- `exec.top_risks` — exactly the top 5, each with likelihood, impact, and a
  stated mitigation-or-acceptance. Not a longer list trimmed for space —
  the actual top 5.
- `exec.core_impact` — what this bet crowds out in the core business. Apply
  the crowding-out test honestly; "none" is almost never true, and saying
  so anyway is the single easiest way to lose the board's trust in the rest
  of the page.

## Step P3 — Proof plan

Per `references/experiment-design.md`: determine the channel — warm B2B or
cold/B2C, read from the bet's motion, buyer, and relationship counts in
`market.current_data` — and the origin (market vs. dogfood, from the
assumption chain and thesis). Choose the instrument per the verbatim
sell-first doctrine block. Heartbeat the channel/origin reasoning out loud
before landing on an instrument — it's the step of this whole skill most
worth arguing with.

`add_experiment` with a falsifiable hypothesis (a hypothesis with a number
in it, not "we'll learn a lot"). Write `proof.experiment_2026`,
`proof.investment`, `proof.milestones`, and the three thresholds
(`proof.threshold_continue`, `proof.threshold_accelerate`,
`proof.threshold_stop`) with numeric `data` where possible, prose-only only
when a metric genuinely resists a number — and say so explicitly when it
does.

## Step P4 — ADVERSARIAL REVIEW LOOP

Per `references/adversarial-review.md`:

1. **Announce it** — "dispatching a fresh-context reviewer — no shared
   history, no author justification." This step cannot be silently skipped;
   skipping requires the owner's explicit "skip review," said back to them
   before moving on.
2. **Dispatch** the subagent (general-purpose) with only (a) the full memo
   rendered from `get_bet` and (b) the review instructions, verbatim — never
   this conversation's history, never a hint about which sections the
   author is proud of.
3. **Surface findings one-decision-per-question** — the reviewer's
   position, the fix, and the cost of ignoring it. Never present findings as
   a wall of text; never resolve them yourself.
4. **Apply accepted fixes** via the normal write tools, revision-logged,
   `via: "bet-plan"`.
5. **Record the round — every time, regardless of outcome.** A round where
   every fix is accepted and folded into the memo leaves no different trace
   than a round where nothing was accepted — both need a durable record, not
   just the one with visible edits. `update_section(bet_id, "exec.top_risks",
   ...)` appending to the existing content: "Adversarial review round N
   (score X/10): <one-line verdict; unresolved dissents listed>", with
   `summary: "adversarial review record"`. This is the only trace a clean
   round leaves in `get_bet` — skip it and a resumed session has no way to
   tell the review ran, and will re-run it needlessly.
6. **Re-dispatch a NEW fresh-context reviewer** — never the same subagent
   context, it would be grading its own suggestions.
7. **Max 2 fix rounds.** After round 2, remaining disagreements are
   RECORDED, not resolved — unresolved reviewer challenges land in
   `exec.top_risks` as named open risks, folded into the same round-record
   block from step 5. Noted dissent, never silent consensus.

## Step P5 — The advance offer

Render the planned→live checklist (client-side, per
`references/gate-progress.md` — never a probe). Draft the exact `rationale`
text — citing the review scores and any recorded dissent — and put it in
front of the owner alongside the ask: **take it live with this rationale:
"<drafted rationale>"?** This is a Tier 3 write — the confirm has to cover
the whole call, not just the yes/no on the stage change; `rationale` is
audit text that lands in the shared system same as `to_stage` does.

- **Yes** → `advance_stage(bet_id, to_stage: "live", rationale, via:
  "bet-plan")` using the confirmed rationale text verbatim. Show the
  returned `{ moved, gate: { checks } }` either way.
- **No** → the bet stays `planned`. Offer `set_status(bet_id, status:
  "parked", rationale)` (confirmed) if the owner wants it shelved instead of
  left active.

Force is available only to `STRATEGY_FORCE_APPROVERS`, with a mandatory
rationale. It is invoked via the `advance_stage` tool with `force: true` and a
`rationale` argument — the caller's email must be in `STRATEGY_FORCE_APPROVERS`
for the override to succeed. This skill never invokes it; an approver does so
deliberately, outside this workflow. It exists for a real edge case, never
suggest it as the easy path around a red checklist or an unresolved review.

## The pipeline (where this sits)

```
bet-research ──▶ bet-plan (pages 4-5, adversarial review,
                            drives planned→live)
             ──▶ bet-run (Phase 5, not built — interim: say so plainly)
```

**Hand-off contracts:** receives bets from `bet-research` (post
research→planned, `market.*`/`econ.*` first-drafted) or `bet-studio`;
hands `live` bets to `bet-run` once `advance_stage` returns `moved: true` —
Phase 5, not built yet, say so plainly rather than improvising a substitute.
Called by `bet-studio`'s "Plan economics / proof plan" hand-off.

## Red flags — STOP

- Downside case = base × 0.8. → The downside is the world where the
  riskiest still-unresolved assumption is wrong, traced to a specific
  assumption row — not a percentage haircut.
- Success thresholds stated in meeting counts for a warm-B2B experiment. →
  Warm partners take meetings for free. Commitment/payment signals only.
- Running the "adversarial review" in the same context that wrote the
  memo. → It must be a fresh subagent with zero shared history — no
  exceptions, no "I'll just be objective."
- A build experiment with no rationale — or a dogfood bet apologizing for
  its build instead of claiming the first-class internal-need rationale and
  testing external willingness to pay. → State the rationale; for dogfood
  bets, the internal need already justified the build.
- A stop threshold the owner wouldn't actually honor if it fired. → Ask
  directly before writing it down; decoration thresholds are worse than no
  threshold.
- More than 2 fix rounds. → Analysis paralysis. Record the dissent in
  `exec.top_risks` and let the owner decide.
- Advancing to `live` without the review on record and without the owner's
  explicit skip. → The review is a required step, not a formality around
  one.

## No token / server missing

If `strategy-studio` MCP calls fail or the tools aren't visible, don't guess
at what would have been written and don't fail silently — print the exact
values each call would have carried (field keys, evidence tags, experiment
`kind`/hypothesis/thresholds, scores) so the human can enter them by hand,
and point at `/connect` or the README's Strategy Studio setup section
(`STRATEGY_MCP_TOKEN`, minted by Kevin, SLT authors only).

## Rationalization table

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The memo is obviously ready; the review is a formality." | The reviewer is fresh-context for a reason. Every author thinks their memo is ready. |
| "I'll review it myself, a subagent is overhead." | You wrote it. You will grade your own homework kindly. Dispatch the subagent. |
| "Round 3 will finally settle it." | Max 2 rounds. Record the dissent in `exec.top_risks` and let the owner decide. |
| "The downside case is just the base case minus a fifth, close enough." | The downside is the world where the riskiest assumption is wrong — trace it, don't discount it. |
| "They're a warm partner, of course a meeting counts as a signal." | Warm partners say yes to meetings for free. The experiment measures what they'll give up. |
| "It's a dogfood bet, I'll just note the build wasn't really tested." | The internal need is a first-class rationale, not an apology — and it still doesn't excuse testing external willingness to pay. |
| "I'll just call `advance_stage` to see the planned→live checklist." | It moves the bet when the gate passes. Compute progress from `get_bet` instead. |
| "The core business impact is basically zero, I'll write 'none.'" | Apply the crowding-out test honestly — "none" is almost never true, and it's the fastest way to lose the board's trust in the rest of the page. |
